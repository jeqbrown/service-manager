## Task Tracking

For each task, we will track:

1. **Status**: Not Started, In Progress, Review, Complete
2. **Assignee**: Team member responsible
3. **Start Date**: When work began
4. **End Date**: When work was completed
5. **Dependencies**: Any tasks that must be completed first
6. **Notes**: Additional context or considerations

## Daily Check-ins

Brief daily check-ins will be conducted to:

1. Review progress on current tasks
2. Identify blockers or issues
3. Adjust priorities as needed

## Progress Update (Current)

As of the latest update, we have made significant progress:

1. Backend model refactoring is complete with optimized relationships
2. Authentication system is fully implemented and tested
3. Deployment infrastructure is fully implemented with Docker and deployment scripts
4. Database migrations are properly organized and tested
5. Documentation for developers is in place
6. Frontend development is complete with all major features implemented
7. Unit testing for React components is in progress
8. Model tracking fields have been implemented across all relevant models

Next priorities:
1. Complete the remaining REST API implementation
2. Finish frontend unit and integration testing for non-auth components
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Complete user documentation

## Weekly Reviews

At the end of each week, we will:

1. Review completed work
2. Assess progress against timeline
3. Adjust the plan as necessary
4. Set priorities for the coming week

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Scope creep | Timeline delays | Strictly prioritize features; defer non-essential items to future phases |
| Technical debt discovery | Additional refactoring needed | Build in buffer time; be prepared to adjust scope |
| Integration challenges | Features not working end-to-end | Early integration testing; don't wait until Phase 4 |
| Performance issues | Poor user experience | Regular performance testing throughout development |

## Definition of Done

A task is considered complete when:

1. Code is written and follows project standards
2. Tests are written and passing
3. Documentation is updated
4. Code is reviewed by at least one other team member
5. Feature is verified in a development environment

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining API endpoints
2. Finish frontend testing suite
3. Set up automated deployment pipeline
4. Gather and implement user feedback
